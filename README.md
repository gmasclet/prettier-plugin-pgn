# Prettier PGN plugin

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and
re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code
when necessary.

This plugin adds support for the Portable Game Notation format to Prettier.

Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a standard plain text format for recording chess games (both the
moves and related data), which can be read by humans and is also supported by most chess software.
